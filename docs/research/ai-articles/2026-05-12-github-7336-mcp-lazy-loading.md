# Feature Request: Lazy Loading for MCP Servers and Tools (95% context reduction possible)

## Problem Statement

Claude Code currently loads all configured MCP servers, tools, and agents at session startup, consuming significant context before any conversation begins. In the reporter's environment:

- **MCP tools**: 39.8k tokens (19.9%)
- **Custom agents**: 9.7k tokens (4.9%)
- **System tools**: 22.6k tokens (11.3%)
- **Memory files**: 36.0k tokens (18.0%)
- **Total**: ~108k tokens (54% of 200k limit)

This leaves only 92k tokens for actual conversation and work, severely limiting complex tasks.

## Proposed Solution

Implement lazy loading for MCP servers and tools, loading them only when needed based on conversation context.

### Core Features

1. **Lightweight Registry System**
   - Load only a small index (~5k tokens) at startup
   - Registry contains tool names, descriptions, and trigger keywords
   - Tools load on-demand when keywords are detected

2. **Intelligent Loading**
   - Analyze user input for relevant keywords
   - Load only required tools for the task
   - Cache loaded tools for session duration
   - Preload related tools that commonly work together

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "optimization": {
    "lazyLoading": true,
    "maxInitialTokens": 5000,
    "autoLoadThreshold": 0.8,
    "cacheMinutes": 30
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "example-server": {
      "command": "...",
      "lazyLoad": true,
      "triggers": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "preloadWith": ["related-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

- **95% Token Reduction**: From 108k to ~5k initial tokens
- **Longer Conversations**: 195k tokens available vs 92k currently
- **Better Performance**: Faster startup, lower memory usage
- **Scalability**: Can add more tools without context penalty

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Lazy Loading
- Add `lazyLoad` flag to MCP server configs
- Load registry instead of full tool definitions
- Implement on-demand loading when tool is called

### Phase 2: Intelligent Preloading
- Keyword-based auto-loading
- Pattern recognition for common workflows
- Tool relationship mapping

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization
- Session-based learning of tool usage patterns
- Predictive preloading based on project context
- Dynamic unloading of unused tools

## User Experience Comparison

**Before (Current)**:
```
Starting session...
Loading 73 MCP tools... [39.8k tokens]
Loading 56 agents... [9.7k tokens]
Loading system tools... [22.6k tokens]
Ready with 92k tokens remaining.
```

**After (With Lazy Loading)**:
```
Starting session...
Loading tool registry... [5k tokens]
Ready with 195k tokens available.

User: "I need to build a React component"
> Auto-loading: context7, magic [+3.5k tokens]
> 191.5k tokens remaining
```

## Additional Context

The issue includes reference to a proof-of-concept implementation in `~/.claude/optimization/` with:
- `tool-registry.json` - Example registry structure
- `lazy-loader.py` - Proof of concept implementation
- `generate-index.py` - Registry generation logic

## Priority

**High** - Critical limitation for power users with many tools and complex workflows.

## Similar Implementations

- **VSCode**: Lazy loads extensions based on file types and activation events
- **JetBrains IDEs**: Load plugins on-demand based on project type
- **Vim/Neovim**: Lazy loading plugins (lazy.nvim, vim-plug with lazy loading)
