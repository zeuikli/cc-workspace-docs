Top Story: DeepSeek V4

What happened

DeepSeek released DeepSeek-V4 Pro and DeepSeek-V4 Flash, its first major architecture refresh since V3 and first clear two-tier lineup, with 1M-token context, hybrid reasoning/non-reasoning modes, an MIT license, and a technical report detailed enough that multiple researchers called it one of the most important or best-written model papers of the year. Across the reactions, the factual consensus is that V4 materially advances open-weight long-context and agentic coding performance while remaining somewhat behind the top closed frontier models overall. Independent benchmarkers place V4 Pro around the #2 open-weights tier, roughly near Kimi K2.6 / GLM-5.1 / strong Claude Sonnet-class to Opus-ish depending on benchmark and mode, with especially strong long-context and agentic performance; opinions diverge on how close it is to GPT-5.x / Opus 4.7 and on whether this is “democratizing” progress or an architecture so complex that few open labs can realistically reproduce it. Key sources include deep-dive commentary from [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953), [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047618271310926151), [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2047665987730993363), [@ben_burtenshaw](https://x.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2047646980139016560), [@TheZachMueller](https://x.com/TheZachMueller/status/2047702488418030066), [@ZhihuFrontier](https://x.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2047664976215839021), and infra/vendor posts from [@vllm_project](https://x.com/vllm_project/status/2047843293447500069), [@NVIDIAAI](https://x.com/NVIDIAAI/status/2047765637808664759), and [@Togethercompute](https://x.com/togethercompute/status/2047743446522224987).

Core facts and technical details

The most concrete technical claims repeated across the discussion:

Two models

V4 Pro: 1.6T total parameters / 49B active

V4 Flash: 284B total / 13B active

Reported by [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953), [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047630981364883816), [@baseten](https://x.com/baseten/status/2047779549644243146), [@NVIDIAAI](https://x.com/NVIDIAAI/status/2047765637808664759)

Context

1M tokens, up from 128K in V3.2 per [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953)

Multiple posters frame this as the headline achievement: “solid ultra-long context” [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047623905754448043)

Training scale

32T–33T tokens cited repeatedly

[@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2047666048334450754) notes 32T tokens over 1.6T parameters, i.e. roughly 20 tokens/parameter

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047630981364883816) cites 33T

[@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2047840706874749076) estimates pretraining compute at ~1e25 FLOPs

Reasoning / modes

DeepSeek exposes three reasoning modes per [@Togethercompute](https://x.com/togethercompute/status/2047743446522224987)

Hybrid “thinking/non-thinking” positioning noted by [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953)

Long-context architecture

Several threads summarize a new hybrid attention system:

shared KV vectors

compressed KV streams

sparse attention over compressed tokens

local/sliding-window attention for nearby context

[@ZhihuFrontier](https://x.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2047664976215839021) gives the most compact public summary:

2× KV reduction via shared key-value vectors

c4a ≈ 4× compression

c128a ≈ 128× compression

top-k sparse attention on compressed tokens

128-token sliding window

1M context KV cache = 9.62 GiB/sequence (bf16)

8.7× smaller than DeepSeek V3.2’s 83.9 GiB

FP4 index cache + FP8 attention cache gives another ~2× reduction

[@ben_burtenshaw](https://x.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2047646980139016560) condenses this to “10× smaller KV cache”

[@TheZachMueller](https://x.com/TheZachMueller/status/2047702488418030066) and [@TheZachMueller](https://x.com/TheZachMueller/status/2047702996524405175) describe CSA + HCA layer patterns, with alternating layers and V4 Flash using sliding-window layers instead of HCA in some places

Quantization / checkpoint format

[@LambdaAPI](https://x.com/LambdaAPI/status/2047654086263320965): checkpoint is mixed FP4 + FP8

MoE expert weights in FP4

attention / norm / router in FP8

claim: the full model fits on a single 8×B200 node

Inference hardware / serving

[@NVIDIAAI](https://x.com/NVIDIAAI/status/2047765637808664759): on Blackwell Ultra, V4 Pro can deliver 150+ TPS/user interactivity for agentic workflows

[@NVIDIAAI](https://x.com/NVIDIAAI/status/2047823093578518758): published day-0 V4 Pro performance pareto using vLLM

[@SemiAnalysis_](https://x.com/SemiAnalysis_/status/2047726025748930687): day-0 support and benchmarking across H200, MI355, B200, B300, GB200/300

[@Prince_Canuma](https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2047685898163147125): DeepSeek4-Flash on 256GB Mac

[@Prince_Canuma](https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2047847095466385899): MLX quants published

[@simonw](https://x.com/simonw/status/2047844236142497850) asks about smaller-RAM Mac viability, implying community interest but incomplete support story

[@QuixiAI](https://x.com/QuixiAI/status/2047765475937890474) reminds users that many local stacks still lack tensor parallel, relevant because V4-class models strongly stress inference infra

License / availability / pricing

MIT license per [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953)

first-party API plus rapid third-party availability via [@Togethercompute](https://x.com/togethercompute/status/2047743446522224987), [@baseten](https://x.com/baseten/status/2047779549644243146), [@NousResearch](https://x.com/mr_r0b0t/status/2047673600900010044), [@Teknium](https://x.com/Teknium/status/2047798102091067677)

V4 Pro pricing: $1.74 / $3.48 per 1M input/output tokens

V4 Flash pricing: $0.14 / $0.28

cache-hit pricing also given by [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953)

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047707820552831028) views the pricing as a glimpse of future “Mythos-level” cheap coding models

Reuters-via-posted quote from [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047760776769720360): DeepSeek said Pro pricing could fall sharply once Huawei Ascend 950 supernodes are deployed at scale in H2

Independent evaluations and where V4 lands

The most useful independent benchmark synthesis came from [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953):

V4 Pro Max: 52 on Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index

up 10 points from V3.2 at 42

becomes #2 open weights reasoning model, behind Kimi K2.6 (54)

V4 Flash Max: 47

positioned around strong mid/high open models, “Claude Sonnet 4.6 max level intelligence”

GDPval-AA (agentic real-world work):

V4 Pro: 1554, leading open-weight models

ahead of Kimi K2.6 (1484), GLM-5.1 (1535), MiniMax-M2.7 (1514)

AA-Omniscience

V4 Pro: -10, an 11-point improvement over V3.2

but still paired with 94% hallucination rate

V4 Flash: 96% hallucination rate

Cost to run AA Index

V4 Pro: $1,071

V4 Flash: $113

Output tokens used on AA Index

V4 Pro: 190M

V4 Flash: 240M

This is a major caveat: cheap per-token pricing does not imply cheap total task cost if the model spills huge token volumes

Additional eval perspectives:

[@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2047714237502677405):

#2 open in Text Arena overall at debut

category wins/placements:

#1 Medical & Healthcare

#15 Creative Writing

#18 Multi-Turn

thinking variant:

#8 Math

#9 Life/Physical/Social Science

[@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2047774037204742255) emphasizes the Pro vs Flash tradeoff:

Pro ranks ~30 places higher

costs 12× more

Flash is still competitive in Chinese, medicine, math

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047682465624445015):

“~Opus 4.5 estimate holds for now, at least on SimpleBench”

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047733998714052819):

V4 is “definitely better than GLM-5.1 but not quite Opus 4.7, GPT-5.4 or Gemini 3.1 Pro”

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047686712051048598) lists what scores would confirm <6 month gap:

ARC-AGI-1 ~75%

ARC-AGI-2 ~35%

GSO ~26%

METR 4.5–5 hours

WeirdML ~63%

[@TheZachMueller](https://x.com/TheZachMueller/status/2047719857869791352):

on his evals, Flash@max ≈ Pro@high on reasoning

Pro focuses more on knowledge (SimpleQA)

[@VictorTaelin](https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/2047818978664268071):

after fixing benchmark bugs and letting long-running models run longer, DeepSeek and Kimi improved materially

[@mbusigin](https://x.com/mbusigin/status/2047707082007220393):

a simple negative early impression with no detail

[@petergostev](https://x.com/petergostev/status/2047773402090426548):

on BullshitBench, not about capability but refusal/pushback behavior, GPT-5.5 underperformed; included here because many readers compare V4 in an eval-skeptical environment

Facts vs opinions

Facts / relatively well-supported claims

V4 Pro / Flash were released with the specs above, MIT-licensed, 1M context, and open technical documentation: [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953), [@TheZachMueller](https://x.com/TheZachMueller/status/2047626252425515240)

The architecture introduces a new long-context attention system with dramatic KV-cache reduction: [@ZhihuFrontier](https://x.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2047664976215839021), [@ben_burtenshaw](https://x.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2047646980139016560)

Independent benchmarkers broadly place V4 Pro near the very top of open weights but below the best proprietary models overall: [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953), [@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2047714237502677405), [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047733998714052819)

DeepSeek V4 is heavily token-intensive in some evaluations: [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953)

The checkpoint uses FP4/FP8 mixed precision and can fit on an 8×B200 node: [@LambdaAPI](https://x.com/LambdaAPI/status/2047654086263320965)

Rapid ecosystem support arrived via vLLM and other providers day 0: [@vllm_project](https://x.com/vllm_project/status/2047843293447500069), [@SemiAnalysis_](https://x.com/SemiAnalysis_/status/2047726025748930687)

Opinions / interpretation

“V4 is ~4–5 months behind the frontier” from [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047618271310926151), [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047622501241434581), [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047626000091971811) is an informed estimate, not a measured fact

“Top three open” vs “only open model close to frontier” debate from [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047616662879248828) is partly about benchmark trust and framing

“Strongest pretrained model we have” from [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047630981364883816) is an opinion hinging on scale + architecture, not direct benchmark supremacy

“Most significant AI paper of the year” from [@Dorialexander](https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/2047632551326413109) is enthusiasm, not consensus

“This is what research should look like” from [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047643722108579936) speaks to transparency/style rather than only capability

“Not exactly a democratizing technology” from [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047840426371977467) is a strong architectural/political interpretation

Different opinions and fault lines

1) Is V4 near frontier, or clearly behind?

More favorable

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047618271310926151): puts it at roughly GPT-5.2 / Opus 4.5+ tier

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047682465624445015): SimpleBench supports ~Opus 4.5

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047630981364883816): argues it is the strongest pretraining base among opens and implies people are underestimating what post-training can do

More skeptical

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047733998714052819): below Opus 4.7 / GPT-5.4 / Gemini 3.1 Pro

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047622501241434581): the gap may widen again because closed labs have bigger models, better science/law/medicine coverage, faster inference with GB200s

[@mbusigin](https://x.com/mbusigin/status/2047707082007220393): early impressions “not great”

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047616897256947967): says polished models like K2.6 and GLM 5.1 may still feel better in coding despite lower intrinsic capacity

2) Is V4’s real contribution model quality, or long-context systems design?

A big split in reactions is that many technical readers think the long-context architecture matters more than the raw benchmark position.

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047623905754448043): “They've completed their quest: Solid Ultra-Long Context”

[@ben_burtenshaw](https://x.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2047646980139016560): first open model where long context and agentic post-training “meet”

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047618271310926151): expects other open labs to adopt pieces of the architecture

[@Dorialexander](https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/2047632551326413109): frames Huawei/sovereignty constraints as an opportunity to reshape hardware and memory/interconnect design

[@jukan05](https://x.com/jukan05/status/2047861732702662741): reads the paper as evidence that NVIDIA’s hardware roadmap is unusually well aligned to where MoE/long-context models are going

3) Is V4 “open democratization,” or too hard to copy?

This was one of the sharpest strategic disagreements.

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047840426371977467): says V4 is “not exactly a democratizing technology” because the architecture is too difficult for most labs to replicate

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047648219081974034): suggests even DeepSeek may not want to do this exact architecture again without refactoring

[@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2047697372831183245): notes the sheer hyperparameter complexity is daunting

Against that, [@Prince_Canuma](https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2047685898163147125) and [@Prince_Canuma](https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2047847095466385899) show that the ecosystem is already compressing and adapting Flash for localish Apple Silicon use, softening the “not democratizing” claim on the inference side if not the training side

4) Are people underrating Flash?

Several reactions suggest Flash may be more important than Pro for practical adoption.

[@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2047774037204742255): Flash shifts the price/performance frontier

[@TheZachMueller](https://x.com/TheZachMueller/status/2047719857869791352): Flash@max ≈ Pro@high on reasoning tasks

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047864952862458009): benchmarks may underweight “legit 1M context for pennies”

[@Prince_Canuma](https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2047685898163147125): Flash runs on 256GB Mac

[@baseten](https://x.com/baseten/status/2047779549644243146) and [@Togethercompute](https://x.com/togethercompute/status/2047743446522224987) emphasize long-document analysis and agentic use cases where Flash’s economics matter

China, chips, Huawei, and sovereignty context

DeepSeek V4 was not discussed as a pure model release; it was treated as evidence in the larger US–China compute and sovereignty debate.

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047625331339661685): Chinese labs are already in or near “takeoff” in the sense that their models help build better models, though still shifted 5+ months behind

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047622501241434581): thinks chip bans are likely to widen the gap in broad domains over time

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047608887616962992), [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047631470664020211): disputes simplistic Huawei-dismissal and notes mixed Chinese sentiment toward Huawei

[@ogawa_tter](https://x.com/ogawa_tter/status/2047631993702363509): points to analysis of Ascend 950 / A3 clusters and V4 deployment plans

[@Dorialexander](https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/2047632551326413109): argues the sovereignty play around Huawei may reshape hardware architecture

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047760776769720360): cites DeepSeek saying prices could drop sharply once Ascend 950 supernodes scale in H2

[@jukan05](https://x.com/jukan05/status/2047861732702662741): interprets V4 as validating NVIDIA’s Blackwell/Rubin/HBM/interconnect strategy

[@NVIDIAAI](https://x.com/NVIDIAAI/status/2047765637808664759), [@NVIDIAAI](https://x.com/NVIDIAAI/status/2047823093578518758): unsurprisingly highlight Blackwell day-0 performance, but this is vendor framing rather than independent proof of strategic superiority

There is also a more ideological thread:

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047645676234846459), [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047638436295725080), [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047835420755415472) argues that Western discourse often misreads Chinese labs as purely state proxies or distillation shops, and instead sees them as serious mission-driven actors. This is interpretive, but it helps explain why the release drew such emotionally charged geopolitical reactions.

Distillation, training data, and data quality

A recurring undercurrent: does V4 mainly reflect architectural innovation, or can critics dismiss it as “distillation”?

[@yacineMTB](https://x.com/yacineMTB/status/2047628416514486661) speculates that some complaints about Chinese distillation may partly come from people discovering they’re outperformed

[@cloneofsimo](https://x.com/cloneofsimo/status/2047628636933812301): “Very interesting... given they distilled claude 🤔🤔”

[@kalomaze](https://x.com/kalomaze/status/2047762970931827125): jokes about DeepSeek training on DeepSeek reasoning traces

On the more substantive side, [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047614729145745623) says DeepSeek’s writing quality, especially Chinese, reflects long-standing obsession with data cleanliness and cites job listings [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047614852055683103), [@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047614975447855485)

[@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2047666048334450754) notes the report still lacks much detail on pretraining data beyond standard categories

Overall, factual public evidence in this tweet set supports “DeepSeek trains at large scale with strong data work,” but not any strong claim about the degree of external distillation beyond speculation

Architecture lineage and prior art

Several researchers pointed out that V4 did not emerge from nowhere.

[@jaseweston](https://x.com/jaseweston/status/2047690308217926055): says DeepSeek uses hash routing from a 2021 ParlAI approach

[@suchenzang](https://x.com/suchenzang/status/2047772636881842629): criticizes routing-induced outliers, with a jab at hashing

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047844368883581404): notes Mixtral-style MoE was a reasonable earlier hack, but claims DSMoE changed things

[@art_zucker](https://x.com/art_zucker/status/2047619111082172548) broadly attacks MoEs as a dead end

[@gabriberton](https://x.com/gabriberton/status/2047835467551547587) counters that MoEs are provably effective despite inelegance

[@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2047874903236645108) is even more positive: “MoEs are amazing”

This matters because V4 was read not just as a stronger checkpoint, but as a possible new design point for open long-context MoEs.

Why the technical report itself mattered

A striking amount of praise was directed not just at the model but at the paper/report quality.

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047618271310926151): “the technical paper is a big deal”

[@Dorialexander](https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/2047632551326413109): “most significant AI paper of the year”

[@morqon](https://x.com/morqon/status/2047643246923325833): “one of the best I’ve ever read”

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047643722108579936): “this is what research should look like”

[@TheZachMueller](https://x.com/TheZachMueller/status/2047626249116303561), [@iamgrigorev](https://x.com/iamgrigorev/status/2047641600591794546), [@nrehiew_](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/2047665987730993363): all signal unusually high effort to digest and test the report

For expert readers, this is important because many frontier releases now arrive with sparse technical disclosure. V4’s report appears to have reset expectations for what a serious open release can look like.

Practical limitations and caveats

Despite the enthusiasm, several caveats recur:

Still behind closed frontier in aggregate capability

especially sciences/law/medicine and broad “general domains” per [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047622501241434581)

Reasoning RL may be undercooked

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047618271310926151): reasoning efficiency not much changed vs V3.2 Speciale

Serving remains hard

[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047643015859118167): many labs serve at only 20–30 tok/s and limited concurrency; running evals can take a day

[@ClementDelangue](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/2047664153439989823): acknowledges concurrency bottlenecks on HF

High token usage

major practical caveat from [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953)

API controls

[@stochasticchasm](https://x.com/stochasticchasm/status/2047717161070989499): notes DeepSeek API appears not to allow sampler control

Adoptability

[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2047840426371977467): too complex for many labs to copy cleanly

Broader implications

Three implications stand out.

Open-weight long-context is no longer just marketing.

V4’s strongest contribution may be proving that 1M context can be made operationally credible in an open-weight model, with concrete KV-cache engineering and open inference support. This is why multiple posters focused less on benchmark deltas and more on systems design: [@ben_burtenshaw](https://x.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2047646980139016560), [@ZhihuFrontier](https://x.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2047664976215839021), [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047618271310926151).

China’s top labs remain competitive in open models, even if not fully closing the closed-model gap.

The benchmark picture across [@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2047735160544841953), [@arena](https://x.com/arena/status/2047714237502677405), and [@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2047733998714052819) suggests Chinese labs now dominate much of the open-weight top tier: Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek, and soon MiMo.

The bar for “open” is rising from checkpoint release to full-stack co-design.

V4 was instantly discussed alongside vLLM, Blackwell, MLX quants, Mac viability, Ascend clusters, and cache/memory architectures. In other words, “the model” is increasingly inseparable from the inference substrate.
